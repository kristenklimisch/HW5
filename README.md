My solution is fully working.

I spent about 10 hours on this assignment. I'm definitely a bit 
slower than many of my classmates on my homework assignments, but I 
feel like I'm understanding everything pretty well, and I'm 
learning strategies to become more efficient as I go.

This was a very useful assignment. I feel much more comfortable
with Junit testing and overridding equals() and hashCode() now.
